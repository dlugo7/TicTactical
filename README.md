# TicTactical
An interesting twist on Tic Tac Toe.

Welcome to Tic-Tactical!
Players (2-4)
Players take turns placing their icon on any open spot on the board.


-- Game End --
The game ends when the board is completely full and no spots
are available to be taken. The final score will then be calculated
and the winning Player and their points will be displayed. GG


-- Scoring Method--
3 in a row - 1 point
4 in a row - 2 points
5 in a row - 3 points
6 in a row - 4 points


-- Overrides --
A key feature of Tic-Tactical is the Override mechanic. If turned on,
players will be able to overtake another players icon/spot. But,
be smart! Each player only gets 1 override per round!
